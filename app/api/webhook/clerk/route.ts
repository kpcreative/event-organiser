    //  ‚úÖ Why you're confused
// In the video you watched, they likely used:

// ts
// Copy
// Edit
// await clerkClient.users.updateMetadata(id, {
//   publicMetadata: { ... }
// });
// That was valid in older versions of the Clerk SDK.

// üì¶ But in your setup, you're using:
// ts
// Copy
// Edit
// import { clerkClient } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
// This version (with clerkClient() as a function that returns a Promise) is used in modern Clerk SDKs (v4.x), where the structure and methods have changed slightly.
