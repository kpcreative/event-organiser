// This code defines a Mongoose schema for an Event model, which includes fields like title, description, location, createdAt, imageUrl, startDateTime, endDateTime, price, isFree, url, category, and organizer. The schema is then used to create a model that can be used to interact with the MongoDB database. If the model already exists in the models collection, it uses that; otherwise, it creates a new one.
// The Event model can be used to create, read, update, and delete events in the database, with references to categories and organizers as needed.
// ðŸ“Œ The Event model is useful for managing events in an application, allowing for easy querying and manipulation of event data.
